Aim To implement the Selection Sort algorithm using Java and sort a given set of integers in ascending order.

Introduction Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Algorithm

Read the number of elements n.
Read n elements into an array.
For each position in the array:
Find the minimum element from the unsorted portion.
Swap it with the element at the current position.
Repeat until the array is sorted.
Display the sorted array.
Source Code The Java implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm is provided in this folder.

Input

An integer n representing the number of elements.
n integer values of the array.
Output

The sorted array in ascending order.
Result The Selection Sort algorithm was successfully implemented in Java, and the input array was sorted correctly.
